<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student of the last semester of computer science with a specialization in software engineering at the West Pomeranian University of Szczecin. I am currently writing my diploma work and looking for my first job as a web application developer. 
<br/><br/>
My favorite stack is React along with Django, but while studying during two engineering team projects, I also was writing backend in Express.js. My favorite place to write code is the backend :desktop_computer:
<br/><br/>
The choice of Django as a backend is due to my interest in perception of machines and pattern recogintion. In the near future, I want to delve into neural networks and experiment with them. -->
